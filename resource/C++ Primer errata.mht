<H1> C++ Primer Errata</H1><EM>Last modified 9 October 2012</EM>=20
<P>Every book has bugs in it, and  <CITE>C++ Primer</CITE> is no =
exception.=20
 This page presents all the bugs that have come to our attention. All of =
these=20
errors will be corrected in the  Second printing, October 2012. Many =
thanks to=20
the careful readers who notified us of these problems! </P>
<H2>Technical errors corrected in the second printing</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>Page 475: The <TT>begin</TT> and <TT>end</TT> members of class=20
  <TT>StrBlob</TT> should be defined outside the class body. They can't =
be=20
  defined until class <TT>StrBlobPtr</TT> is complete.=20
  <LI>Page 522: The <TT>remove_from_Folders</TT> member correctly =
removes=20
  pointers to itself from each of its  corresponding <TT>Folder</TT>s, =
but it=20
  should <TT>clear</TT> its own <TT>folders</TT> member as well.=20
  <LI>Pages 525=E2=80=93528: The <TT>alloc</TT> member of =
<TT>StrVec</TT> should be a=20
  static member of the class, not a data member of each object. To fix =
this=20
  error, add the <TT>static</TT> keyword to the declaration of =
<TT>alloc</TT>
   inside the <TT>StrVec</TT> class and provide a definition of the form =

  <OL><TT>allocator&lt;string&gt; StrVec::alloc; </TT></OL>inside the=20
  implementation file for <TT>StrVec</TT>.=20
  <LI>Page 567: In the <TT>StrBlobPtr::operator--()</TT> function, the =
call to=20
  check should pass <TT>curr</TT> as the first argument, not =
<TT>-1</TT>.=20
  <LI>Page 762: The <TT>EOF</TT> preprocessor variable is defined in the =

  <TT>cstdio</TT> header not <TT>iostream</TT>. </LI></UL>
<H2>Clarifications and improvements made in the second printing</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>Page 175: The <TT>scores</TT> <TT>vector</TT> should be defined as =
=20
  <TT>const</TT> because we do not want the elements in <TT>scores</TT> =
to be=20
  changed.=20
  <LI> Pages 576=E2=80=93578: The <TT>div</TT> class reuses the name of =
a C library=20
  function. C++ compilers are permitted to put C library names into the =
global=20
  namespace. To avoid potential conflicts  rename this class =
<TT>divide</TT>.=20
  <LI> Page 780: Drop  "are equivalent" from the last sentence of the=20
  highlighted box titled <EM>Backward Compatibility: Exception=20
  Specifications</EM>. These declarations both say that <TT>recoup</TT> =
won't=20
  throw, but there are subtle distinctions between what the compiler is=20
  permitted to do with these declarations. </LI></UL>
<H2>Typographical errors corrected in the second printing</H2>
<UL>
  <LI> Pages xxvi and 22 the correct web address for the book code is <A =

/title/0321714113</A>=20
  <LI> Page 155: The explanation of why we use an <TT>unsigned</TT>=20
  <TT>long</TT> rather than an <TT>int</TT> should say that we need "at =
least=20
  27" bits, not that we need "at least 17" bits.=20
  <LI>Page 158: The last sentence before the exercises for <TT>4.10</TT> =
should=20
  say that we  "reset the current element" not the "next element".=20
  <LI>Page 177: The second comment in the first two code examples should =

   include <TT>7</TT> as a grade that will get a minus.=20
  <LI> Page 225: In the third sentence before the <I>Tip</I> box, should =
read=20
  "<TT>string</TT> named <TT>ret</TT>" not  "<TT>string</TT> named =
<TT>s</TT>".=20
  <LI>Page 229: The type alias declaration in the code example at the =
top of the=20
  page  should define <TT>arrT</TT> not <TT>arrtT</TT> and the last =
comment in=20
  that example should say that "<TT>func</TT> returns a pointer  to an =
array of=20
  ten <TT>int</TT>s" not five <TT>int</TT>s.=20
  <LI> Page 236: Last sentence before the last code example should be  =
"For=20
  example, to override the default for <TT>backgrnd</TT>, we must also =
supply=20
  arguments for <TT>ht</TT> and <TT>wid</TT>:"=20

"argument=20
  in the call". </LI></UL>
